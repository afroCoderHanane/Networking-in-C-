# Networking in C++

This project is a chat between a server and a client over TCP where all messages are encrypted and sent and decrypted by the receiver

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Run in terminal and follow instructions

git clone https://github.com/hananeDev84/Networking-in-C-

### Prerequisites

you need to install ubuntu to have the socket available for you
Ubuntu is a free software 
https://ubuntu.com/#download
Rufus
https://rufus.ie/

CodeBlocks IDE
Available 
```

```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be
Watch video below to boot Ubuntu to Usb key and Install it

Code blocks


```
Download and Install from Ubuntu Store
```


End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

Demo video soon available

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
run the server
it should print ("Server is listening")
Run the Client code 
it should connect and print at the server side 
(" ")
and this(">) at the client side
```


## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
Run .msb file for the server and client separatly in code blocks. 
An alternative is to access the debug file in each documents and run it from console
eig : cd Documents/MS/bin/Debug +[Enter]
      Next: ./MessageServer
      ***ls is to see file inside the actual folder you are in now
